     mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It was founded by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White. An Android app is a software application 
     running on the android platform.

  b. Android apps can be written using Android Software Development Kit.  
  
  c. Kotlin, Java, and C++ are some languages commonly used in the development of android apps.

  d. When user start or open an android application, it will undergo various states and that is called as Android Activity Cycle. 
     These are the callbacks which are invoked when activity enters a new state:
     onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy().

	Checkboxes
	RadioButtons
	Edit Text
	Progress Bar
	Seek Bar
  
  f. Some salient features of Kotlin are as follows:
	Concise code. Codes can be written in less number of ines
	Null safety. Reduce app crashes.
	Easily understandable code.	
	Interoperability with Java.
     
     Similarities between C++ and Kotlin:
	Kotlin is a statically typed programming languag like C++.
	Both suppoorts classes and method of OOP.
	Like C++ its entry point is also main function. 

     Some salient features of Java are as follows:
	It is simple.
	It is a fully object ariented programmin language with all OOP features such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
	It supports functional programming.
	It is secure and robust.
     
     Similarities between C++ and Java:
	The syntax is very similar.
	Both are object oriented.
	Main function is the entry point for both languages.
	data types are similar.
