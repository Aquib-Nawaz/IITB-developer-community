# Android   
  a. Android is a **mobile operating system** based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software. It is          designed      primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It was founded by **Andy Rubin, Rich Miner,      Nick Sears, and Chris White**. An Android app is a software application running on the android platform.

  b. Android apps can be written using **Android Software Development Kit**.  
  
  c. **Kotlin, Java, and C++** are some languages commonly used in the development of android apps. Instiapp uses Java language.

  d. When user start or open an android application, it will undergo various states and that is called as Android Activity Cycle. 
     These are the callbacks which are invoked when activity enters a new state:
     **onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy().**

  e. Five different UI elements are:
      -	Checkboxes
      -	RadioButtons
      -	Edit Text
      -	Progress Bar
      - Seek Bar
  
  f. Some **salient features of Kotlin** are as follows:                                 
      - **Concise code**. Codes can be written in less number of ines                               
      -	**Null safety**. Reduce app crashes.                                                  
      -	**Easily understandable code.	                                           
      -	Interoperability with Java.**                                                
     **Similarities** between C++ and Kotlin:                                 
      -	Kotlin is a statically typed programming languag like C++.                               
      -	Both suppoorts classes and method of OOP.                                   
      -	Like C++ its entry point is also main function.                                                                         
     Some **salient features of Java** are as follows:
      -	It is **simple**.                                                                                          
      -	It is a fully **object oriented programmin language** with all OOP features                            
      -	It supports **functional programming**.                            
      -	It is **secure and robust**.                                                                        
     **Similarities** between C++ and Java:                                   
      -	The **syntax** is very **similar**.                            
      -	Both are **object oriented**.                                             
      -	**Main function** is the entry point for both languages.                            
      -	**data types** are **similar**.                                           

# TASK

 1.  The **basic building block** for **user interface** is a **View object** that is created from the View class and occupies a              rectangular area on the screen.                             
     The **ViewGroup is a subclass of View**. One or more Views can be grouped together into a ViewGroup. A ViewGroup provides the            **android layout** in which we can order the appearance and sequence of views. Examples of ViewGroup are **LinearLayout,                FrameLayout, RelativeLayout etc.**                                                                                     
     **LinearLayout** : is a ViewGroup that aligns all children in a single direction,  vertically or horizontally.                 
     **RelativeLayout** : is a ViewGroup that displays child views in relative positions                        
        
 2.  Various features are as follows:
      - Option to **login or logout.**
      -	Option to **Sell.**
      -	**Notification.**
      -	**Search Option.**
      -	Book **Categories.**
      -	**Recommendation.**
      -	**Latest Search**
